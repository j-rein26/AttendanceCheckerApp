This app allows the user to upload a csv file with the attendance from a certain week. The app then will find those who last attended anywhere from 2-8 weeks before the date of the csv report.
The user can then check the attendees. If the person was actually in attendance, then the user can delete that name from the list.
The user can then download the final output to an excel file.
This app was designed to generate a specific report. It can easily be changed to the parameters that a unique user might want.
