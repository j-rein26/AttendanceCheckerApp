I made this app with my intermediate knowledge of python in combination with AI. This app receives data from a google sheets doc. that the user uploads. The app then will find those who last attended anywhere from 2-8 weeks before the date of the uploaded report.
The user can then check the attendees. If the person was actually in attendance, then the user can delete that name from the list.
The user can then save the final report. The final report is saved into a google sheets doc. When the saved button is pushed a new button appears to download the final output to an excel file.
This app was designed to generate a specific report. It can easily be changed to the parameters that a unique user might want.
